# Analyzing custom survey report

The dashboard in the reports section displays the overall ESAT score and the question page.

![Dashboard displaying overall ESAT score.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 6.17.18 PM.png>)

Each collated score is in three color codes – green, amber, and red – denoting the severity of responses.

### Question score page

The question score page helps HR identify the employee sentiment at an overall level. This score is calculated on the basis of questions asked in the survey.

Besides displaying an overview of the overall employee sentiment, the question score page also details:

1. How well are the participants doing or feeling under every question set in the survey. For instance, in the above image, each column displays the questions asked in the survey and their corresponding overall scores are in the following row.
2. How well a particular L1 leader or manager’s team is doing under each particular in the survey. Admins can also access the overall ESAT score for every department in the organization under the ESAT Score column.&#x20;

In the above image, Alex, Bethany, and Cindy are the L1 leaders. The first row represents the overall score of all the departments subject to the survey. However, the subsequent rows represent the score of the organization of each manager. You can click on any of the leader’s rows and drill down scores further in their organization.

**Note**: Drill down of scores is a significant tool to narrow down the aspects that need more attention and improvement in an organization.

The report overview table follows a hierarchical display of responses that assists in drilling down particular departments or employees under certain managerial leadership facing issues in the organization.

For instance, in the above report overview, the corporate department has as many as 99 employees reporting to Alex Stein.

Once you click on the corporate department’s profile, you will be led to another report overview with all the team reporting Alex Stein’s org. This report is a hierarchical representation of the org and displays the corresponding responses received by each manager’s org that affect the overall rating for each question asked in the survey.

To drill down further, let’s say you sort the ESAT score in a decreasing order to examine the manager’s org facing the lowest employee satisfaction.

This method re-orders Ashley Richardson’s org on top reflecting the lowest ESAT amongst all.

On clicking Ashley Richardson’s profile, you will again be led to another report overview with particular managers under his leadership contributing to his overall ESAT score.

However, just before the manager’s org report, there will also be a row with direct reports. Direct reports signify the responses of employees directly reporting to that manager, and in this case, people directly reporting to Ashley Richardson. Therefore, direct reports are the representation of all the managers’ sentiments towards the survey who are directly reporting to Ashley.

Finally drilling down to Amni Bass’s org with the lowest ESAT score in the report overview, you will be directed to the root-cause issues causing employee dissatisfaction in the organization for Alex Stein’s corporate department.

**Note**: Sorting in the above table is another helpful tool that immediately brings forth the department or leadership in need of attention.
