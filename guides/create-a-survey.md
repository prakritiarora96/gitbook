# Create a survey

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Please ensure that the hierarchy is correct. The tool does not allow the process of survey creation in case of any errors in the hierarchy, like missing managers or cyclic loops.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Go to the Survey tab (2nd icon in the left panel).

![The second tab on your home page is the surveys tab.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 5.03.22 PM.png>)

**Step 2**: Click on Create Survey from the top-right most corner of the screen.

![Click on create survey button to begin.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 5.06.39 PM.png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Create Survey button would only be enabled for the subscription users. For subscription users, please contact us at [support-10xpeople@xto10x.com](mailto:support-10xpeople@xto10x.com).
{% endhint %}

**Step 3**: Find the relevant template that you want to roll out or create your own survey by selecting Create Custom Survey option.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: You have the liberty to add or remove the questions from the template surveys to tailor the template according to your requirements. You can also re-arrange the questions by dragging them in your desired order.
{% endhint %}

![Select your choice of survey.](<../.gitbook/assets/Create survey options.png>)

**Step 4**: Select the Create Survey option in the pop-up if the organization hierarchy is correct. If the errors in the hierarchy persist, they must be fixed before you continue the custom survey creation journey. After you fix the hierarchy, you will have to restart the process from Step 1.

**Step 5**: Select the audience for whom you want to create the survey.

![Select the audience for the survey.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 5.33.53 PM.png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: You can select either of the two options in the “Who is this survey for?” option:

**1.  Employee’s full org**

This option allows you to select the entire organization or cherry-pick the various departments under the founders and as specified in your organization hierarchy. Once selected, you can also include the selected manager in the survey by clicking the toggle option on the right side of the page under the Selected managers section.

**2. Employee’s direct reports**

Select Employee’s direct reports option if you want only the people reporting directly in the organization chart to the employee.
{% endhint %}

**Step 6**: Once you have selected the desired audience, press the Continue button to add questions.

![After selecting the audience, click on Next Step button and subsequently on Continue button.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 5.37.06 PM.png>)

**Step 7**: You can now add custom survey questions by clicking on the **+ Add a custom question** option. In case you chose a template custom survey, you can review the pre-existing questions before adding more to the survey.

![You can add custom survey questions from scratch from this window.](<../.gitbook/assets/Add custom question.png>)

![Templatized custom survey allows you to add custom questions.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 5.45.41 PM.png>)

**Step 8**: Add custom question pop-up that will guide you in selecting the type of questions that you want to ask in the survey. A drop-down menu will give you the choice between a 4-point Likert scale question and a qualitative question.

![Select the type of question and enter the question that you want to ask with its short text.](<../.gitbook/assets/Type of question.png>)

**Step 9**: Type your qualitative question and its short text for question in the section below to Add question.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: While framing custom 4-point Likert scale questions, admins should take care to frame their questions with a positive tone.

e.g. Suppose you want to ask your audience about receiving managerial support and assistance to cope with situations induced by the pandemic.

The appropriate question would be “My manager has been checking-in and offering all support required in this situation” instead of a statement “I feel over-worked and burdened with little or no support from my manager’s end."&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 10**: Once you have added your particular set of questions, select the Preview & Continue button to preview all the questions in a new pop-up. You can re-arrange the order of the questions or go to Next Step if you’re satisfied. In case you wish to edit a question, you can select the Edit Questions button to go back. After doing the needful, you may again Preview & Continue to the next step.

![Preview the questions to continue.](<../.gitbook/assets/Preview questions.png>)

**Step 11**: Add Basic Details to differentiate your Custom Survey by giving it a unique name, specifying the date and time for the start and the end of the survey.

![Give your survey a unique name and schedule its beginning and end to continue.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-24 at 5.56.59 PM.png>)

**Step 12**: The Preview & Schedule window\* will display the particulars of the survey with the option to edit, in case of dissatisfaction. Once previewed, select the Schedule Survey option to schedule the Custom Survey.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Under the Communications tab on the Preview & Schedule window, you can also Preview the Survey launch email. Through the Survey reminder email service, the 10xPeople tool will also intimate and remind the non-respondents to fill the survey in time for accurate results.
