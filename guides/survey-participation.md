### Participation report

The participation report gives detailed information about the number of responses collected from selected L1 leaders and managers. The report is only accessible to HR but its selected access can be given to L1 leaders through the Report Access option when the survey has been completed (top right-most corner). In case the survey is in progress, HR cannot share the participation reports with anyone else.
