#### Organization health heatmap

The custom survey report helps identify the exact areas to improve your ESAT through an organization's health heatmap. Every attribute or particular is in a range of colors denoting:

Green – Organizations’ core strengths

Amber – Areas that need improvement. Callout areas where employees believe that the organization can improve

Red – Areas that require immediate attention and fixing in the organization
