### Survey question score breakdown

10xPeople tool offers three kinds of survey scores:

1. ESAT score \
   Employee satisfaction score is accessible only for the template custom surveys. It accounts for the rating for all the subjects in the survey.
2.  1-10 response Likert scale score

    All the quantitative questions asked in the survey are on a 4-point Likert scale, which is later converted into a 1-10 response scale score in the final report. The custom survey report allows you to examine scores for each of the particulars under different managers.
3.  Qualitative response

    The qualitative response sheet carries the responses for all the qualitative questions asked in the survey. These responses are on overall and department-wise categories, which are downloadable.
