# What to do next?

The ESAT score provides attributes for improvement in the organization. It assists in future decision-making by identifying the areas and/or management that require attention.

The factors marked in Red in the custom survey report demand immediate action. These factors contribute to decreasing employee satisfaction in the organization and thus, require instant redressal.

### Identifying the area for improvement

There are two axes to identify the areas for ESAT improvement:

1.  **Vertical axis**

    If any component in the vertical axis of the tabular data in Report Overview is red, it implies that the concern is organization-wide and needs immediate action.
2.  **Horizontal axis**

    If any component in the horizontal axis or along the column of the tabular data is red, it implies that a particular managerâ€™s department is impacting the overall ESAT score of the organization. You can suggest the concerned department or L1 leader take measures to improve ESAT and launch a separate survey to gauge the satisfaction status.
