# What is Custom Survey?

A 10xPeople custom survey is a tool that allows HR or the admin to create surveys tailored to their needs for assessing frequently occurring concerns and/or event-led repercussions with only a few questions.

## Need for custom survey

Every organization, regardless of its employee composition, faces operational and functional hurdles during its day-to-day proceedings. Custom surveys allow the HRs to gain insights about the organization-specific subjects and take appropriate measures.

**Good to know:** Custom surveys are crucial to improve the Employee Satisfaction (ESAT) score and the overall health of the organization.

Here are a couple of examples of the use case of custom surveys:

> A custom survey is pivotal to gauge the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the organization. Despite a functional organization, the employees may be potentially nearing a burn-out due to significant operational changes. In this case, a custom survey would help drill down the departments facing the most issues or the most common subject bothering employees across all departments in the organization.

> Similarly, if an organization witnesses a mass epidemic breakout amongst its employees which impacts as much as 50% of the workforce, a custom survey can help reach out to the rest of the employees to gauge their workload and sentiment during such trying times.

Thus, a custom survey is also useful for HRs and admins to get stock of concerns like Work from Home setup, COVID Pulse Check, and Dynamic Work Environment, among several other concerns hampering the progress of the organization.

If you want to check the pulse of the entire organization, you can conduct an eNPS survey for accurate results.

## Outcome of custom survey

A company-wide event drives a custom survey. Therefore, the outcome of the custom survey or the Report Overview summarizes the employee feedback on the concerned event.

The report of the custom survey helps identify the areas for improvement in the organization that decrease the overall ESAT. It also highlights the subjects demanding immediate redressal to improve the health of the organization.
